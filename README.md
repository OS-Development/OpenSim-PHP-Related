OpenSimRelatedPHP
=================

PHP Scripts i wrote for opensim to help grid owners with their grid.

ossearch.php is a websearch page so residents can search from within their viewer.

oswelcome.php is a login welcome page that can be loaded up when someone is about to log into a grid.

Both are free open source under GPL v2. You can modify and give out copies to others, all i ask is credit for first making the pages come to me.
And as for development, im welcome to accept any and all fixes and what not.

Any problems please feel free to email me chrisx84@live.ca or get me on skype with that email address.

More scripts coming since i see in Robust.ini that the opensim dev's are working on supporting more php based features.
